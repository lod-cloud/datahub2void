For version 0.1.1 (hopefully 2010-07-18), I'd like to:

	* Implement all of the package search parameters.
	* Implement the rest of the search API.
	* Review and implement any of the model API resources I missed.
	* Review exception handling and improve it.
	* Review documentation and improve it (both inline and external).

For version 0.1.2 (hopefully 2010-07-25), I'd like to:

	* Thoroughly review the entire codebase to make sure there are no bugs.
	* Despite the fact the CKAN server returns a no-cache header, I'd like to 
	  implement optional caching. Seems silly to hit the server for every
	  request.
	* Improve the search_display() method: extensibility and peformance.

For version 0.1.3 (???), I'd like to:

	* Create a WordPress plugin that uses this client.
