WHAT THIS IS

This project is about generating a voiD description of all the datasets
in the LOD Cloud diagram. It currently generates an RDF dump containing
these descriptions, available online here:

   http://lod-cloud.net/data/void.ttl

The plan is to publish that dump in linked data format as well.


BACKGROUND

The LOD Cloud diagram [1] is a pictorial of datasets published in
linked data format [2] on the Web.

Metadata for these datasets is recorded in CKAN [3], an open directory
of datasets. The lodcloud group in CKAN [4] contains metadata for all
the datasets in the LOD Cloud diagram.

voiD [5] is a vocabulary for expressing metadata about such datasets
in RDF format.

RUNNING IT

~$ php generate.php

This takes a few minutes. It creates a file void.ttl in the current
directory.


DETAILS

This uses Ckan_Client-PHP for accessing the CKAN API.

This uses some code taken from Neologism and DBpedia to serialize
Turtle via ARC2. This code is found in rdfwriter.inc.php. The class
offers an API that's a bit nicer than ARC2's triple representation,
it fixes some bugs related to literal serialization in ARC2's
TurtleSerializer, and tweaks the layout of the produced Turtle to
provide (subjectively) nicer-looking Turtle output.


TODO

- Add foaf:primaryTopic from entity URIs to doc URLs
- add HTML generation
- update documentation in this file
- publish the generated RDF as linked data
- update everything via cronjob
- add a voiD description for this dataset
- better validation for URIs, triple numbers, etc
- create the two ov: terms I used at open.vocab.org
- Better/other vocabulary for tags?
- Interpret some more of the tags?
- Do something with sparql_named_graph custom field
- Do something with other custom fields
- Do something with version field
- Better consolidation of authors/maintainers
- consolidate the fixed TurtleWriter and contribute back to ARC
